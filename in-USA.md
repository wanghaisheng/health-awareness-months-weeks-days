Have you ever heard of Breast Cancer Awareness Month (October)? How about [Eating Disorder](/health/eating-disorders) Awareness Week (the last week of February)? Maybe World AIDS Day (December 1)?

Chances are you’re familiar with at least one of these well-known health awareness observances. But did you know the calendar is full of special months, weeks, and days that raise awareness for a variety of important health issues and conditions? There are at least [24 different awareness campaigns](https://www.healthline.com/health/cancer/cancer-ribbon-colors) for cancer alone.

Awareness months, weeks, and days are important because they allow people with certain health conditions, along with their loved ones, advocacy organizations, and support groups, to rally around a common cause: health. Educational, fundraising, and support events are often held during these times.
